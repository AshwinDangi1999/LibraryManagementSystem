# Library Management System - Requirement Document

## 1. **Introduction**

This document defines the functional and non-functional requirements for a **Library Management System (LMS)**. The system will be designed to handle the management of library operations such as managing books, users, and transactions in a digital format.

## 2. **Objectives**

The Library Management System aims to:
- Streamline the process of borrowing and returning books.
- Allow easy access to book catalogs.
- Maintain records of books, users, and transactions.
- Provide an intuitive interface for librarians and users (students, staff, etc.).
- Enable reports and analysis for better library resource management.

## 3. **Scope**

The system will handle the following functionalities:
- **Book Management**: Add, edit, delete, search, and categorize books.
- **User Management**: Register, update, and delete users (students, faculty, and staff).
- **Transaction Management**: Track book borrowing, returns, and overdue fines.
- **Search and Reports**: Advanced search for books and user reports (borrowed books, fines, etc.).
- **Notifications**: Notify users of due dates, fines, and book availability.

## 4. **Stakeholders**

- **Library Admins/Librarians**: They will manage books, users, and transactions, including setting up fines and managing overdue books.
- **Users (Students, Staff, Faculty)**: They will search for books, borrow, and return books, and track their transactions.
- **System Admin**: Responsible for overseeing the technical aspects of the system such as backups, updates, and security.

### 5.4 **Search and Reporting**
- **Book Search**: Users and admins can search books based on:
  - Title
  - Author
  - ISBN
  - Genre/Category
- **Transaction History**: Users can view a history of borrowed books, due dates, and fines.
- **User Reports**: Admins can generate reports such as:

- **Book Availability**: Real-time information about book availability for users.

### 5.5 **Notification System**
- **Due Date Reminders**: Send reminders to users about approaching due dates for borrowed books.
- **Overdue Fines Notification**: Notify users about overdue fines.
- **Book Availability Notification**: Notify users when reserved books are available.

### 5.6 **Security and Access Control**
- **Authentication**: Users and admins must log in using secure credentials (username/password).
- **Authorization**: Different access levels for different types of users:
  - Admins: Full access (manage users, books, and reports)
  - Users: Limited access (borrow books, view personal transactions)
- **Session Management**: Ensure users are logged out after inactivity.

## 6. **Non-Functional Requirements**

### 6.1 **Performance**
- The system should handle up to 5000 concurrent users without degradation in performance.
- Search queries should return results within 2 seconds.

### 6.2 **Usability**
- The system should have a user-friendly interface.
- The system should be accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

### 6.3 **Reliability**
- The system should be available 24/7 with an uptime of 99.9%.
- Backup of user data and transaction history should be taken daily.

### 6.4 **Security**
- All sensitive data, including user passwords, should be encrypted using strong encryption algorithms.
- The system should follow industry-standard security practices to protect user data from unauthorized access.

### 6.5 **Scalability**
- The system should be scalable to accommodate more users, books, and transactions as the library grows.

### 6.6 **Compliance**
- The system should comply with all data protection regulations such as GDPR or any relevant local law.

## 7. **System Architecture**

### 7.1 **Technology Stack**
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or Angular)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Python (Django/Flask), or Java (Spring Boot)
- **Database**: MySQL or PostgreSQL
